\title{Create a Base Rate Model}
\usage{
bs_model_baserate(expected, normalize = TRUE, name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{expected}{Numeric vector of expected values or proportions.
E.g., population counts, area sizes, or any prior expectation.}

\item{normalize}{Logical; normalize expected to sum to 1?}

\item{name}{Optional name for the model}
}
\value{
A \code{bs_model_baserate} object
}
\description{
Creates a model that compares observed events to expected rates based on
a known baseline (e.g., population). This addresses "base rate bias" where
patterns in visualizations are dominated by underlying factors like population
density.
}
\details{
Under the base rate model, expected proportions are defined by the
\code{expected} vector. The likelihood measures how well observed data
matches these expected proportions:

\deqn{P(D|BaseRate) = 1 - \frac{1}{2} \sum_i |O_i - E_i|}

For example, if region A has 10\% of the population, we expect 10\% of events.
Regions with event rates matching their population share show low surprise;
regions with disproportionate rates show high surprise.

This is the primary tool for de-biasing choropleth maps.

\examples{
# Population-weighted base rate
population <- c(10000, 50000, 100000, 25000)
model <- bs_model_baserate(population)

# Use in model space
space <- model_space(
  bs_model_uniform(),
  bs_model_baserate(population)
)
