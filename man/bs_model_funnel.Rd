\arguments{
\item{sample_size}{Numeric vector of sample sizes (e.g., population)}

\item{target_rate}{Target rate/proportion. If NULL, estimated from data.}

\item{type}{Type of data: "count" (Poisson) or "proportion" (binomial)}

\item{formula}{Formula for likelihood computation:
\itemize{
\item "paper" (default): Matches Correll & Heer (2017) exactly.
Uses dM = Z * sqrt(pop_frac) and P(D|M) = 2*pnorm(-|dM|).
\item "poisson": Uses Poisson-based SE and normal PDF as likelihood.
}}

\item{control_limits}{Numeric vector of control limits (in SDs) for funnel plot.
Default is c(2, 3) for warning and control limits.}

\item{name}{Optional name for the model}

\description{
Creates a model that normalizes observations by their expected standard error,
accounting for varying sample sizes. This addresses "sampling error bias"
where regions with small sample sizes show artificially high variability.
}
\details{
The de Moivre funnel model uses the insight that sampling variability
decreases with sample size according to de Moivre's equation:
\deqn{SE = \sigma / \sqrt{n}}

With formula = "paper" (recommended):
The model uses the exact formulas from Correll & Heer (2017):
\deqn{Z = (rate - mean_rate) / stddev_rate}
\deqn{dM = Z \times \sqrt{population / total\_population}}
\deqn{P(D|M) = 2 \times \Phi(-|dM|)}

With formula = "poisson":
For count data (Poisson), the model computes z-scores as:
\deqn{z = (observed - expected) / \sqrt{expected}}

For proportion data (binomial):
\deqn{z = (observed - expected) / \sqrt{p(1-p)/n}}

Observations with large z-scores (far from expected after accounting for
sample size) are genuinely surprising, while high rates in small regions
are discounted as expected variation.

This model is essential for:
\itemize{
\item De-biasing per-capita rate maps
\item Creating funnel plots
\item Identifying genuine outliers vs. sampling noise
}

\examples{
# Population sizes for regions
population <- c(10000, 50000, 100000, 25000)

# Funnel model matching the paper (recommended)
model <- bs_model_funnel(population, formula = "paper")

# Funnel model with known target rate
model <- bs_model_funnel(population, target_rate = 0.001)

# For proportion data with Poisson-based formula
model <- bs_model_funnel(population, type = "proportion", formula = "poisson")
}
