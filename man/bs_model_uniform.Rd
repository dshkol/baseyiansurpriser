\title{Create a Uniform Model}
\usage{
bs_model_uniform(n_regions = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_regions}{Number of regions (optional, inferred from data if NULL)}
}
\value{
A \code{bs_model_uniform} object
}
\description{
Creates a model that assumes events are equally likely across all regions.
This serves as a "null hypothesis" baseline - regions where events cluster
will show high surprise under this model.
}
\details{
Under the uniform model, expected probability for each region is 1/n,
where n is the total number of regions. The likelihood is computed as:

\deqn{P(D|Uniform) = 1 - \frac{1}{2} \sum_i |O_i - \frac{1}{n}|}

This is the Total Variation Distance from uniform, transformed to a probability.

The uniform model is useful for detecting spatial clustering - any
concentration of events in fewer regions will produce high surprise.

\examples{
# Create uniform model
model <- bs_model_uniform()

# The model computes likelihood when used in a model space
space <- model_space(model)
}
