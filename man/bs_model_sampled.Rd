\usage{
bs_model_sampled(
  sample_frac = NULL,
  kernel = "gaussian",
  bandwidth = "nrd0",
  n_grid = 512,
  sample_indices = NULL,
  name = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_frac}{Fraction of data to use for building the prior (0 < x < 1).
If NULL, uses all data for density estimation.}

\item{kernel}{Kernel type for density estimation.
One of: "gaussian", "epanechnikov", "rectangular", "triangular", "biweight",
"cosine", "optcosine"}

\item{bandwidth}{Bandwidth selection method or numeric value.
If character, one of: "nrd0", "nrd", "ucv", "bcv", "SJ".
If numeric, used directly as bandwidth.}

\item{n_grid}{Number of points in the density estimation grid (default: 512).
Higher values give smoother estimates but use more memory.}

\item{sample_indices}{Integer vector of specific indices to use for building prior.
Overrides \code{sample_frac} if provided.}

\item{name}{Optional name for the model}
}
\value{
A \code{bs_model_sampled} object
}
\description{
Creates a non-parametric model using kernel density estimation (KDE).
This model is built from a sample of the data and can detect when
subsequent observations deviate from the pattern established by early data.
}
\details{
The sampled model builds a density estimate from a subset of observations
(typically early observations in temporal data) and measures surprise as
deviation from this learned distribution.

This is useful for:
\itemize{
\item Detecting temporal changes in distribution
\item Building a "post hoc" model from initial observations
\item Detecting emerging patterns in streaming data
}

The likelihood for each observation is the density at that point under
the KDE built from the sample.

\examples{
# KDE model using first 10\% of data
model <- bs_model_sampled(sample_frac = 0.1)

# KDE with specific bandwidth
model <- bs_model_sampled(bandwidth = 5)

# Use specific observations for training
model <- bs_model_sampled(sample_indices = 1:10)
}
